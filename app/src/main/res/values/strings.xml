     • An atom is the smallest particle of the  element that can exist independently
and retain all its chemical properties. \n\n
• Dalton’s atomic theory, which
suggested that the atom was indivisible
and indestructible. But the discovery
of two fundamental particles (electrons
and protons) inside the atom, led to
the failure of this aspect of Dalton’s
atomic theory.\n\n
• Thomson proposed that:
i. An atom consists of a positively
charged sphere and the electrons
are embedded in it.
ii. The negative and positive charges
are equal in magnitude. So, the atom
as a whole is electrically neutral.\n\n
• Rutherford’s alpha-particle scattering
experiment led to the discovery of the
atomic nucleus. Rutherford’s model of
the atom proposed that a very tiny
nucleus is present inside the atom and
electrons revolve around this nucleus.
The stability of the atom could not be
explained by this model.\n\n
• Neils Bohr’s model of the atom was
more successful. He proposed that
electrons are distributed in different
shells with discrete energy around the
nucleus. If the atomic shells are
complete, then the atom will be stable
and less reactive.\n\n
• J. Chadwick discovered presence of
neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. So,
the three sub-atomic particles of an
atom are: (i) electrons, (ii) protons and
(iii) neutrons. Electrons are negatively
charged, protons are positively charged
and neutrons have no charges. The
mass of an electron is about 1/2000
times the mass of an hydrogen atom.
The mass of a proton and a neutron is
taken as one unit each.\n\n
• We know that protons are present in
the nucleus of an atom. It is the number
of protons of an atom, which
determines its atomic number. It is
denoted by ‘Z’. All atoms of an element
have the same atomic number,Z. In fact,
elements are defined by the number of
protons they possess.\n\n
• Mass of an atom is practically due to
protons and neutrons alone. These are
present in the nucleus of an atom.
Hence protons and neutrons are also
called nucleons. Therefore, the mass of
an atom resides in its nucleus.\n\n
• Isotopes are atoms of the same
element, which have different mass
numbers.\n\n
• Isobars are atoms having the same mass
number but different atomic numbers.\n\n
• To bind a nucleus together there must
        be a strong attractive force of a totally
different kind. It must be strong enough
to overcome the repulsion between the
(positively charged) protons and to
bind both protons and neutrons into
the tiny nuclear volume. This force is
called Nuclear Force.\n\n
• The nuclearforce is much strongerthan
the Coulomb force acting between
charges or the gravitational forces
between masses. The nuclear force
between neutron-neutron, protonneutron and proton-proton is
approximately the same. The nuclear
force does not depend on the electric
charge.\n\n
• Radioactivity occurs when an atomic
nucleus breaks down into smaller
particles. There are three types of
nuclear radiation: alpha, beta, and
gamma. Alpha particles are positively
charged, beta particles are negatively
charged, and gamma particles have no
charge. The radiations also have
increasing levels of energy, first Alpha,
then Beta, and finally Gamma, which
is the most energetic of all these. Alpha
and Beta are particles, but Gamma is a
wave.\n\n
• When a radioactive nucleus changes,
the remaining nucleus (and atom) is not
the same as it was. It changes its
identity. The term half-life describes
the time it takes for half of the atoms
in a sample to change, and half to
remain the same.\n\n
• There is even a radioactive isotope of
carbon, carbon-14. Normal carbon is
carbon-12. C-14 has two extra neutrons
and a half-life of 5730 years. Scientists
use C-14 in a process called carbon
dating. This process is not when two
        carbon atoms go out to the mall one
night. Carbon dating is when scientists
try to measure the age of very old
substances. There are very small
amounts of C-14 in the atmosphere.
Every living thing has some C-14 in it.
Scientists measure the amount of C-14
in the things they dig up to estimate
how old they are. They rely on the
half-life of 5730 years to date the object.\n\n
• Fission is the splitting of an atom. Not
all atoms will go through fission; as a
matter of fact, very few do under
normal circumstances.\n\n
• In a nuclear reaction, scientists shoot a
whole bunch of neutrons at uranium235 atoms. When one neutron hits the
nucleus, the uranium becomes U-236.
When it becomes 236, the uranium
atom wants to split apart. Afterit splits,
it gives off three neutrons and a lot of
energy. Those neutrons hit three other
U atoms in the area and cause them to
become U-236. Each cycle, the reaction
gets three times bigger. A reaction that,
once started, continues by itself, is
called a chain reaction.\n\n
• Fusion is the process of two small
atomic nuclei coming together to make
a larger nucleus which is stable. The
simplest nuclei to use are deuterium
and tritium (isotopes of hydrogen).
